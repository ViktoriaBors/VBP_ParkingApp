# Park IT
## ProOktatas C# Developer bootcamp - 2.Modul (Pro - mobile and webdevelopment)

### **_Introduction_**
During the 2 months C# "Pro" module, I have learned the basics of Xamarin with a taste of Asp.Net.The project itself is a basic parking app.

### **_Used Technologies_**
1. C#
2. MySQL
3. Xamarin
4. Geolocation

## **_The project itself_**
The user can save numberplates and start a parking with a specific registered numberplate. After the user stop the parking, the app calculates the price with a basic of 8 HUF / minutes.

**Aim of the Project**

The main objective of this project is to create a simple Xamarin mobile app with database interaction and file reading/writting, which is saved on the mobile device. 

**Challenges within the project**
I decided to have less interaction with database and save the data just after the parking stopped. This might boost up performance, but also means that if the user close the app totally, the parking data is lost. I am awarre of this faulty function - I might change it later on.
Other approach I took is to try different xamarin forms design, like carousel. 
Lastly, I have added a "Get geolocation" button, where I tried enable geolocation and get the coordinates. This could be a start to get some data about the nearby parking houses fee and use that to calculate price. This requires(free?) api interaction, which also needs to be further developed later on. 

## **_What have I learned_**
1. Tons of OOP approach
2. Database structure
3. C#
4. MySQL
5. Xamarin
